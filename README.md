# Expression Tree Evaluator

This project builds, prints, and evaluates arithmetic expressions using a **binary expression tree**.  
You will parse **postfix expressions** (Reverse Polish Notation), build an expression tree, and then use recursion to evaluate and print it.

---

## Learning Goals

By completing this assignment, you will:

- Understand **expression notations**: infix, prefix, postfix (RPN).
- Learn how to convert **postfix ‚Üí expression tree** using a stack.
- Use **recursion** to traverse and evaluate binary trees.
- Practice **dynamic memory management** `malloc()`.

---

## Background Concepts

### Expression Notations
- **Infix**: operators between operands  
  Example: `(3 + 4) * 5`
- **Postfix (RPN)**: operators after operands  
  Example: `3 4 + 5 *`
- **Prefix**: operators before operands  
  Example: `* + 3 4 5`

 Postfix is easy for computers because order of evaluation is explicit ‚Äî no parentheses needed.

### What is `tokens`?
- `tokens` is an **array of strings** read from the input file.  
- Each element is one **operand** (like `3`, `x`) or one **operator** (like `+`, `*`).  
- Example: if the file contains:
  ```
  3 4 + 5 *
  ```
  then:
  ```c
  tokens[0] = "3"
  tokens[1] = "4"
  tokens[2] = "+"
  tokens[3] = "5"
  tokens[4] = "*"
  count = 5
  ```

## üì¶ The Stack (provided in `stack.c`)

The **stack** is already implemented for you. It is used to build the expression tree from postfix input.

### üîé How the stack works
A stack is a **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** data structure.  
- Imagine a stack of plates: you can only add (push) to the top, and remove (pop) from the top.  
- Example sequence:
  1. Push `3`
  2. Push `4`
  3. Pop ‚Üí removes `4`
  4. Pop ‚Üí removes `3`

This is exactly how we manage operands and operators when building an expression tree.

### Provided functions
```c
void push(Stack *s, Node *node);
Node* pop(Stack *s);
bool isEmpty(Stack *s);
```

#### 1. `push(Stack *s, Node *node)`
- Places a node on **top** of the stack.  
- You will use this when you encounter an operand (number/variable) or a newly created operator node.  
- Example:
  ```c
  Node *n = createNode("3");
  push(&stack, n);
  ```

#### 2. `Node* pop(Stack *s)`
- Removes and returns the node from the **top** of the stack.  
- You will use this when handling an operator: pop the right operand first, then the left operand.  
- Example:
  ```c
  Node *right = pop(&stack);
  Node *left = pop(&stack);
  ```

#### 3. `bool isEmpty(Stack *s)`
- Returns `true` if the stack has no elements, `false` otherwise.  
- You can use this as a safeguard to make sure you don‚Äôt pop from an empty stack.  
- Example:
  ```c
  if (!isEmpty(&stack)) {
      Node *n = pop(&stack);
  }
  ```

### Usage in building the tree
1. **Push operands** (numbers) directly as nodes.  
2. When you see an **operator**:
   - Pop the **right operand**.
   - Pop the **left operand**.
   - Create a new operator node with these as children.
   - Push the new node back.  

At the end, the stack will contain **one node**: the root of the expression tree.

## üß© Your Task in `tree.c`

Students only need to implement **two functions**:

### 1. `createNode()`
```c
Node* createNode(const char *token);
```
- Allocate memory for a new node.
- Copy the `token` string into the node.
- Initialize left and right children to `NULL`.

**Write your code below the comment markers:**
```c
// write your code here
```

---

### 2. `buildExpressionTree()`
```c
Node* buildExpressionTree(char *tokens[], int count);
```
- Use the stack functions (`push`, `pop`) to build the tree.
- Algorithm:
  1. Loop over all tokens.
  2. If operand ‚Üí `createNode()` ‚Üí push.
  3. If operator ‚Üí pop right, pop left ‚Üí `createNode(op)` ‚Üí attach children ‚Üí push.
  4. After loop, pop once ‚Üí root.

**Write your code below the comment markers:**
```c
// replace this comment with your code
```

## üñ®Ô∏è Printing, Evaluating, and Freeing the Tree

These are already implemented:
- `printInfix(Node *root, FILE *out);`
- `int evaluate(Node *root);`
- `void freeTree(Node *root);`

You do **not** need to change them.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Main Program

`main.c` is provided and does the following:

1. Reads filenames from command-line args:
   ```bash
   ./expr input.txt output.txt
   ```
2. Reads tokens (postfix expression) from `input.txt`.
3. Calls your `buildExpressionTree()`.
4. Prints the infix form and evaluation to `output.txt`.
5. Frees all memory with `freeTree()`.

---

## üß™ Testing Your Program

## ‚ö° Key Takeaways

- `tokens` is the **postfix expression split into strings**.  
- `createNode()` builds nodes for operands/operators.  
- `buildExpressionTree()` uses the **stack** to combine nodes.  
- You only edit `tree.c`, under the **"write your code here"** markers.  
- The rest of the code (stack, printing, evaluation, freeing) is already done for you.
